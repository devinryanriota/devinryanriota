### Hi there, I'm Devin Ryan Riota ğŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer who enjoys working on the whole stack (backend, frontend, infra & more!) and experimenting with new approaches/tech stacks. I sometimes share my experiences through writing (currently on [Medium](https://medium.com/@devinryanriota), not sure where I'll write in the future ğŸ¤”) and I co-host a tech related podcast at [positif.dev](https://positif.dev/) (it's in Indonesian ğŸ˜†).
