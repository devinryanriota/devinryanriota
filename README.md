### Hi there, I'm Devin Ryan Riota 👋

I'm a Software Engineer who enjoys working on the whole stack (backend, frontend, infra & more!) and experimenting with new approaches/tech stacks. I sometimes share my experiences through writing (find it on my [blog](https://devinryanriota.com/blog)) and I co-host a tech related podcast at [positif.dev](https://positif.dev/) (it's in Indonesian 🇮🇩).
