### Hi there, I'm Devin Ryan Riota ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer who enjoys working on the whole stack (backend, frontend, infra & more!) and experimenting with new approaches/tech stacks. Recently, I'm gaining more interest in hardware. I sometimes share my experiences through writing (find it on my [blog](https://devinryanriota.com/blog)).
