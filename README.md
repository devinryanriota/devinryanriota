## Hi there, I'm Devin Ryan Riota 👋

I'm a Software Engineer who enjoys working on the whole stack (backend, frontend, infra & more) and loves experimenting with new things!. Recently, I'm gaining more interest in hardware and networking. I sometimes share my experiences through writing (find it on my [blog](https://devinryanriota.com/blog)).

### Career
Over the span of my 8-year career, I've worked across companies of different stages and scales: 
- [Airy](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/airy-rooms) - Started my career in a mid-stage hospitality startup, as a software engineer working on backend, frontend, and infrastructure.
- [Traveloka](https://www.traveloka.com) - Joined a well established organization with hundreds of engineers, handling some of their core services which receives thousands of requests per second. 
- [Cosmart](https://www.cosmart.id) - Joined a super early stage startup as the first engineer, built the initial MVP that helped raise $5M in seed funding, then leading and growing the engineering team to 15 people across different roles (backend, frontend mobile & web, quality assurance, and data analyst). 

Alongside these full time roles, I'm also working as a tech consultant for several companies. The role varies, from helping businesses streamline their internal operations through tech, to helping companies build the MVP of their products early in their journey.
